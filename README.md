# Terminal-Battleship

This is the battle of warships in the oceans of a linux terminal. Developed using C++ and the "ncurses" library, it provodes an advanced interface for interaction with the game. 


# Notes from the Developer
Because it was made as part of a university assignment, it is not of the highest quality. I tried to overdeliver the part of using arrow keys for input. Still, the issues are that there is no option of palying against the computer, no way to see your board as well as where you've bombed the opponent simultaneously, and a few minor bugs here and there.
